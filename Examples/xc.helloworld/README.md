# XComponent Hello World

This project is a classic `Hello World` program applied to [XComponent](http://www.xcomponent.com).

## Overview

XComponent is a platform to create, monitor and share microservices.
If you want to have more details about microservices, you should read [Martin Fowler's article.](http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html)

In the `Hello World` sample we're actually going to run two different pieces of software concurrently:
* **`[Hello World microservice]`** - A microservice that receives *say hello* requests 
* **`[Console Application]`** - A simple application to test our microservice

## Build the project

```
PS > ./build.ps1
