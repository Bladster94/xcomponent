## Overview

XComponent is an open platform to easily create, control and share microservices.
In XComponent, a microservice is a set of components. Each component is based on state machines.
This approach is powerful and flexible because it enables you to size or resize your microservices as you want.

XComponent provides the following tools:
* XCStudio: an application to design / compose components and microservices
* XCRuntime: an execution environment for xc microservices
* XCSpy: a test tool
* XComponent AC2: an application to deploy and control microservices
* XComponent Gallery: it enables you to share easily your projects

The following figure is a good summary of the XComponent architecture.

> Note: "Microservice architectural style is an approach to develop a single application as a suite of small services, each running in its own process and communicating with lightweight mechanisms. These services are built around business capabilities and independently deployable by fully automated deployment machinery.‚Äù *James Lewis & Martin Fowler*
